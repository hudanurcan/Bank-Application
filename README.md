Users can apply for an account, log in to view and update their account information, perform money transfers, and manage their balances. 
Additionally, users can perform deposit and withdrawal transactions through the Online ATM feature.
The application also includes security measures such as data encryption and KVKK (Personal Data Protection Law) consent to ensure the protection of personal data in a secure environment.
